# 📊 Customer Campaign Response Analysis

This project explores customer response patterns to marketing campaigns using the **4Ps of Marketing** — Product, Price, Place, and Promotion. The dataset includes customer demographics, purchase behavior, and campaign engagement, providing insights into how different customer segments respond to various marketing efforts.

---

## 📝 Description

This analysis focuses on:
- Segmenting customers based on age, income, education, and family structure.
- Visualizing spending patterns across product categories.
- Investigating the effectiveness of marketing campaigns.
- Testing hypotheses (e.g., Do customers with kids prefer online shopping?).

Using **Seaborn** and **Plotly**, interactive and static visualizations reveal how customer demographics influence marketing campaign acceptance.
